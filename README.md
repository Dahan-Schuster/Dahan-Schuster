### Hello, fellow coder!

Wellcome to my personal page. There's nothing special here, I'll just add some shortcuts for my personal works and keep a updated resume of what I do in general. Thanks for reading!

Github suggested these topics, so I'll use it:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on web and mobile development, focused on React and React Native 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Shell Scripting and Linux. I use linux 95% of the time for years, but I'm still a regular user with just some basic knowledge, so I try to learn a little more everyday and, when there's something I always do in the terminal, I try to write simple scripts for it. Currently I (try to) use Bash, but I'm looking forward to learn more Python and write more complex scripts with less effort haha Checkout my [Linux Utils](https://github.com/Dahan-Schuster/linux-utils) repository!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on science! Currently I'm in college studying Computer Engineering, so in the next years I'll be learning Electronics and doing science, the thing I love the most in this world
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with writing my own projects from ground. It's still a hard challenge for me to start and finish projects on my own, so help in the process is always wellcome!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, React and Front-end, these are the tools I use and know the most. But I can try to help you with Linux and Shell Scripting too, as with some other languages like Java, C and PHP, and some Electronics stuff :D
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ They/them; ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Ele/dele, Elu/delu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to play board-games in my free time, and pretend to code some of them in the future. We can play together in [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com)

#### Code shortcuts

- Check if is root
```bash
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]
  then echo "Please run as root"
  exit
fi
```

- Ask for confirmation (yes/no)
```bash
# simple way, with read command
read -p "Are you sure? " -n 1 -r
echo   # (optional) move to a new line
if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
    exit 1
fi

# sofisticated way, with select command
echo "Do you wish to install this program?"
select yn in "Yes" "No"; do
  case $yn in
    Yes ) make install;;
    No ) exit;;
  esac
done
```

- Linux usage utils
```bash
# see disk usage
du -sh <file or directory>

# real time system monitoring
top

```

- Bcrypt hash for '1234' password (very userful for test users)
