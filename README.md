### Hello, fellow coder!
 
Wellcome to my personal page! I'm a trans non-binary person that spends lots of time either using my computer or playing boardgames with friends haha

There's nothing special here, I'll just add some shortcuts for my personal works and keep a updated resume of what I do in general. Thanks for reading!

Github suggested these topics, so I'll use it:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on web and mobile development, focused on React and React Native
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Shell Scripting and Linux Ricing. I use linux 95% of the time for years, but I'm still a regular user with just some basic knowledge, so I try to learn a little more everyday and, when there's something I always do in the terminal, I try to write simple scripts for it. Currently I (try to) use Bash, but I'm looking forward to learn more Python and write more complex scripts with less effort haha Checkout my [Linux Utils](https://github.com/Dahan-Schuster/linux-utils) and [dotfiles](https://github.com/Dahan-Schuster/dotfiles) repositories!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with writing my own projects from ground. It's still a hard challenge for me to start and finish projects on my own, so help in the process is always wellcome!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, React, Front-end and Linux Ricing, these are the things I know most. But I can try to help you with Python and Shell Scripting too, as with some other languages like Java, C and PHP, and some Electronics stuff :D
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ They/them; ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Ele/dele, Elu/delu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to play board-games in my free time, and pretend to code some of them in the future. We can play together in [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com)

#### Code shortcuts

- Check if is root
```bash
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]
  then echo "Please run as root"
  exit
fi
```

- Ask for confirmation (yes/no)
```bash
# simple way, with read command
read -p "Are you sure? " -n 1 -r
echo   # (optional) move to a new line
if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
    exit 1
fi

# sofisticated way, with select command
echo "Do you wish to install this program?"
select yn in "Yes" "No"; do
  case $yn in
    Yes ) make install;;
    No ) exit;;
  esac
done
```

- Linux usage utils
```bash
# see disk usage
du -sh <file or directory>

# real time system monitoring
top

```

- Bcrypt hash for '1234' password (very userful for test users)
